This package uses plain text lists of package names to generate
per-distro, per-architecture packages for debathena-thirdparty:

lists/common: Common package list
lists/$(lsb_release -sc): Per-distro amendments to the common list

The lists files have a specific syntax:
Line                            Meaning
----                            -------
packagename                     Depend on packagename
packagename otherpackage        Depend packagename and otherpackage
                                but remove otherpackage if packagename
                                cannot be installed (useful for, e.g.
                                not installing helper applications if
                                the real application isn't there)
package1 | package2             Depend on package1 or package2.  Unlike
                                dpkg syntax, will only short-circuit
                                from the left (package2 will not be
                                checked unless package1 has no
                                installation candidate)
?packagename                    Recommend package name
#something                      A comment (will be ignored)

The lists files for specific codenames have a slight variation on the
above syntax.
Note: conditional (|) is not accepted in distro-specific files

+packagename                    Depend on packagename, even if it
                                cannot be found in the APT cache
                                (use with care)
-packagename                    Remove packagename entirely (it may
                                still be pulled in if something else
                                depends on it, but this package will
                                neither Depend nor Recommend it)
